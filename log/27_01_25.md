# Starting the project

I have been wanting to do this for a while. 

The idea is to make a generative model which can name climbing routes from a description. 

Turns out it is not a novel idea. [This guy](https://www.mattritter.me/?p=267) made a great attempt of generating descriptions in 2020

I find the names of routes so fun. In Portland there is one called "Captain Lob Meets the Nipple Pincher" and "Shatter My Illusions but Don't Break My Heart".

They are a part of climbing sub-culture. 

## Plan

Collect a bunch of data, probs generated from Gemini 1.5 Flash and OpenAI batch apis cause they are cheap and models these days seems to know most routes in the UK.

Build some sort of transformer model, starting with gpt2 and moving into present day :)

see how far I get. 

Might not work, but I should learn something.

## Log

Collecting data. 

Gemini sdk doesnt seem to be working for structured output. I am only geting the name, missing description and grade :(

Using OpenAI sdk seems to have fixed it. They are cross compatible. Probs a skill issue for me with the google sdk. 

Got rate limited after 500 odd examples. 

Need to scale up. I reckon I need like 10k to have any good go at this.

First I am generating places where there is lots of climbing.

Then generating routes. 

Ahh shoot descriptions aren't very long. Updated the prompt from "brief descriptions" to "the classic description of the route as in a climbing guidebook"

Plan is to keep making more and running this. Then I will dedupe by description. There will be duplicate names but that's fine I think. 

routes.json - initial test.
routes_2.json - much longer (20x in size) changed prompt to ask for at least 100 per area
routes_3.json - asked for full descriptions.
